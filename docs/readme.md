3.  Use an Arrow Functions

# What is a function?

Functions tend to be task-specific modules of code, that are created for a specific purpose. It is generally suited to smaller tasks, but they can become as complicated as needed (or grow steadily over the years avoiding refactor, lurking in the shadow-code, until one day, maybe found. Or maybe not. A little much?). 

Back to the task at hand. Functions generally do something specific, with a structure 
such as:

1.  Takes no inputs, and does something (an output)
2.  Takes some inputs, and does something (an output)
3.  Or perhaps it is a function that uses many arguments, and even other functions, with multiple outputs.
