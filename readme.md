### Planning

- Feature plan
- Develop user stories
  - “As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that
    [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
  - Features should not need you there to explain them to users
- Plan out the structure of your JSON requests

### Project Pitches

Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your
instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

- The basic story of your application
- The core features of your MVP
- The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
- Challenges you expect to face
- How you are meeting the requirements of the project

Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.
