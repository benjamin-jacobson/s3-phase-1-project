### Planning

- Feature Plan & User Stories
  - “As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
  - "As a influencer, I want to be able to make memes with text, so I can get lots of likes and laughs"
  - "As a user, I want to be able to see memes other people have made"
  - "As a user, I want to have my meme on the website for others to see." 

- Plan out the structure of your JSON requests
  - GET request to meme generator API to generate a meme
  - GET request to local json database to show all existing memes already created
  - POST request to local json database to add new meme to

- The core features of your MVP
- The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it

Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.
